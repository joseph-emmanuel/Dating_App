Required functionality:
Your application must use PHP, W3CSS or BootStrap
There are three levels of user: invited, regular member, premium user (see the
memberLevel array)
After a user logs in they can:
• View and modify their profile (personal info, images, whether to
receive notifications...)
• Upload a photo to their profile
• View and modify their favourite users list
• View profiles of other members via a search function which can filter
and sort profiles
• Send a wink to another users
• See winks received from other users
Depending on a user's profile settings, they may be notified via email when a user
is added or removed from their favourite list.
Advice:
List the features on paper.
Create a mockup of your web page(s). Distribute tasks between team members.
!!!! Create the database before starting to write code !!!! Feel free to add more
functionality to your database. It is easier to not use information stored in your
database than it is to totally rework it. !!!
Before writing any code, write the steps of your algorithm in plain English
sentences. When you are implementing your algorithm, use the plain English
sentences as the comments explaining your code. This methodology forces you to
first conceptualize your algorithm before trying to implement it. This should make it
easier for you to design your application. Comments are often neglected and
postponed until the very end of the project, and this method avoids that!
If you are not familiar with any feature of PHP, do some small tests to make sure
you understand before trying to integrate it into your application.
Things that could be added or improved:
• Add a member rating system
• Add private messaging between users
• Add a chat feature to your web page
• Add forums to your web page
• Add an admin member level that can ban and suspend user accounts
• Add a matching algorithm that pairs members according to their activity
level, type of partner sought, geographical proximity ...
• Internationalize your site
